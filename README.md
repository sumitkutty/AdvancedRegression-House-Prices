# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques (Kaggle Competition.

#### Objectives: 
* Training a machine learning algorithm to predict the price of a house using a number of features about the house and the property.

#### Packages:
* Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

#### Data:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

#### Methods Used:
* Data Cleaning: Handling null values from various features are handled either by removing them or by imputation.<br/>
* Feature Engineering: Performed label encoding, one-hot encoding and other transformations on multiple features to transform the data into a suitable form.
* Equalised the features of train set and test set to reconcile.
* Feature Selection: Selected significant features using feature selection method like chi2.
* Predictive Modelling: Used various algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forest to predict the prices of the house given the features.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Tuned the hyperparameters in random forest regression using grid search cross validation technique.

Evalutation:
* R<sup>2</sup> : 0.86
